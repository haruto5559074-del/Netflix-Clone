# Netflix-Clone
built a Netflix-inspired web app to replicate its core UI/UX, focusing on modern design, responsive layouts, and smooth animations. This project features an animated sign-in, intuitive navigation, and movie browsing layouts. It helped me master component-based design, UI/UX principles, and scalable, reusable code for real-world platforms.
